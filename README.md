## Building and running tests

This single command should set up the workspace and run the tests

```
cd tests
go test
```

## Installing the neo-go compiler

This is optional but you can get a neo-go binary to compile and disassemble contracts. You can get it from [its official repository](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neo-go/tree/master).

The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neo-go/blob/master/docs/compiler.md).
